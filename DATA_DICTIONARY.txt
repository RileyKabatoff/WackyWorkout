RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN TABLES
================================================================================

RELATIONSHIP TYPE: ONE-TO-MANY (Multiple relationships)
- One user (parent) can have many workouts (children)
- One user (parent) can have many goals (children)
- Each workout belongs to exactly one user
- Each goal belongs to exactly one user

JOIN CONDITIONS:
users.user_id = logged_workouts.user_id
users.user_id = goals.user_id

REFERENTIAL INTEGRITY:
- Foreign key constraint ensures every workout has a valid user_id
- ON DELETE CASCADE: When user is deleted, all their workouts are deleted
- This maintains data integrity and prevents orphaned records

================================================================================
DATA VALIDATION RULES
================================================================================

USERS TABLE:
- username: Must be unique across all users
- email: Must be unique and valid email format (validated in application)
- password: Minimum 6 characters, hashed before storage (validated in application)
- streak: Cannot be negative (enforced by application logic)

LOGGED_WORKOUTS TABLE:
- sets: Must be greater than 0 (CHECK constraint)
- reps: Must be greater than 0 (CHECK constraint)
- weight: Must be non-negative, allows decimals for precision
- difficulty: Must be one of: 'easy', 'moderate', 'hard', 'extreme'
- user_id: Must reference existing user in users table (FOREIGN KEY)

GOALS TABLE:
- target_value: Must be greater than 0 (CHECK constraint)
- current_progress: Must be non-negative (CHECK constraint)
- is_completed: Must be 0 or 1 (CHECK constraint, acts as boolean)
- user_id: Must reference existing user in users table (FOREIGN KEY)
